Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?
    Utilizing the information from two tables as they relate to each other. It's useful to get specific information about a person or multiple people that shows more than just one facet of thier info. Like getting the people who liked a particular post's usernames.



2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
    For starters, because it would make it so that the posts table had tons of informaiton, making it even harder to sift through. Additionally, other tables might want to access user information such as the username or first and last name without wanting or needing any of the post informaiton like the image or caption.
